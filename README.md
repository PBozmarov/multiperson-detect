# Problem
This project provides an end-to-end solution to ensure people are verifying their identities online of their own free will, not under pressure from others. We're developing tools to detect when more than one person might be involved in the verification process, keeping online identity checks safe and truly voluntary.



# Solution
End-to-end model that returns 1 if the video contains more than one person at any given moment, 0 otherwise.


To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `test_env.yaml` file.
3. Run the following command to create a new conda environment named `<myenv>` using the configuration in `test_env.yaml`:

   **`conda env create -f test_env.yaml --name <myenv>`**

   Replace `<myenv>` with your desired environment name.

After executing this command, your new environment should be set up and ready to use.
