To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `test_env.yaml` file.
3. Run the following command to create a new conda environment named `<myenv>` using the configuration in `test_env.yaml`:

   **`conda env create -f test_env.yaml --name <myenv>`**

   Replace `<myenv>` with your desired environment name.

After executing this command, your new environment should be set up and ready to use.
